# First Test Repo

ðŸ§ª A simple test repository to practice terminal commands, Git basics, and working with GitHub.

## What I practiced

- `mkdir`, `cd`, `touch`, `cat`, `ls`
- `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git status`
- Creating and editing a `README.md` file
- Pushing a local repo to GitHub using SSH

## About this repo

This project is part of my learning journey at Powercoders.
It was created to test the full Git workflow from local terminal to GitHub.
